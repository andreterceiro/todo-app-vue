# Todo App with VueJS

Todo simple app with VueJS. One thing I still want to do is put the entire persistence part (saving and retrieving data) in an external file, so I can easily change the strategy. Today it is in index.html even using Local Storage.

I will want to create several ways to save the data, such as:

- in Local Storage itself, as it already is;
- In a PHP API (I rent shared hosting on Locaweb and can save there) using MySQL as the database server;
- In a Node.JS file using DynamoDB as the database server;
- In a Rails API using (by my choice) SQLite as the database server.

In the future I will do these things.

Another thing I also need to do is put the Javascript that is in a script tag in the
index.html in an external file.
